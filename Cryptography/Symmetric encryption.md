Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for encrypt and decrypt using the same keys. The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties. All parties must have access to keys and it's the main drawback of this approach.
